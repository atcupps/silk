Cartographer is a simple and intuitive web extension that helps you discover if products are cheaper in other countries â€” and lets you request those items from people traveling there.

We believe in helping people save money by connecting them with travelers willing to help.
Whether you're buying skincare from Korea, tech from Japan, or fashion from Europe, Cartographer helps make it possible.

When a user is detected to be on a shopping website, Gemini is used to search for if the product is cheaper in other countries, and a popup is given to inform the user of this cheaper price.
If a cheaper version is wanted, a request can be filed for travelers to bring back.

Our tech stack is built with:
- React frontend using Material UI and Chakra
- Gemini for identifying product prices
- Google Search for image generation
- Supabase for relational database storage
- Typescript Express for data manipulation
